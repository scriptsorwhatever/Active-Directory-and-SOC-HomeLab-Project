Welcome to my Active Directory and SOC HomeLab Project! This repository contains a comprehensive [guide](https://github.com/scriptsorwhatever/Active-Directory-and-SOC-HomeLab-Project/blob/main/Detailed-Setup-Guide.md)
 to setting up an Active Directory environment, integrating it with Splunk for logging and analysis, and using Kali Linux for red team activities. This project is designed to demonstrate my technical skills and is part of my portfolio on GitHub.

## Project Overview

This project will guide you through:

1. **Setting Up Active Directory**: Install and configure a Windows Server with Active Directory, create domain users, and join a Windows 10 machine to the domain.
2. **Integrating with Splunk**: Configure Sysmon for logging and set up Splunk to query and analyze telemetry data from your server and target machine.
3. **Performing Red Team Activities**: Use Kali Linux to execute brute force attacks and generate telemetry, which can be analyzed using Splunk.
4. **Installing Atomic Red Team**: Run tests to see the telemetry generated by various attack simulations.
5. **Troubleshooting and Learning**: Encounter common issues, troubleshoot them, and learn how to resolve them.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the following:

- Oracle VirtualBox
- Windows Server 2022 ISO
- Windows 10 ISO
- Kali Linux ISO
- Splunk Free version
- Ubuntu Server ISO

## Steps to Follow

### Building the Diagram
- **Objective**: Understand the importance of creating a network diagram for your lab setup.
- **Outcome**: A basic diagram of your network setup.

### Downloading and Installing Assets
- **Objective**: Download and install Windows Server 2022, Windows 10, Kali Linux, and Splunk using Ubuntu Server in VirtualBox.
- **Outcome**: A fully set-up VirtualBox environment with all necessary assets installed.

### Configuring Sysmon and Splunk
- **Objective**: Install and configure Sysmon for logging and set up Splunk to ingest and analyze telemetry data.
- **Outcome**: A Splunk instance receiving logs from your Windows server and target machine.

### Setting Up Active Directory
- **Objective**: Configure Active Directory on your Windows Server and promote it to a domain controller.
- **Outcome**: A functioning Active Directory environment with domain users and a joined target PC.

### Performing Attacks and Analyzing Telemetry
- **Objective**: Use Kali Linux to perform brute force attacks and analyze the generated telemetry using Splunk.
- **Outcome**: Insights into the telemetry generated by attacks, and experience in using Splunk for security analysis.

## Additional Resources

- **Splunk Documentation and Training**: Learn more about creating alerts, dashboards, and reports with Splunk.
- **Atomic Red Team**: Explore various attack simulations and their telemetry.

## Conclusion

This project aims to enhance your understanding of Active Directory, Splunk, and security operations. By following along, you will gain hands-on experience in setting up and managing a secure IT environment.
